# Skill Point Award Events Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a skill point award event system to the Insurance Simulation Game. Players can now earn skill points through various in-game events, track their point history, and receive notifications through the inbox system when points are awarded.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Point Award System**
   - Enhanced the tech tree module to track and display skill point awards
   - Added functionality to award points based on different event types
   - Integrated with the player profile system for persistence

2. **Point History Tracking**
   - Players can view a complete history of earned skill points
   - Points history is displayed in a modal with event details and timestamps
   - History is stored persistently and loaded on game start

3. **Event Notifications**
   - Added notifications for point awards
   - Integrated with the inbox system to show messages related to point-earning events
   - Visual feedback when points are awarded

4. **Admin Testing Interface**
   - Added testing buttons for administrators to simulate different event types:
     - Performance achievements (e.g., meeting financial targets)
     - Innovation events (e.g., implementing new systems)
     - Educational achievements (e.g., completing training programs)

5. **Persistence**
   - Updated the data storage system to save and load point history
   - Points and history are maintained across game sessions

## Technical Implementation

1. **Modified Files**
   - `modules/tech_tree_module.R`: Enhanced to track and display skill point events
   - `backend/data_ops.R`: Updated to store point history with skills
   - `app.R`: Added test triggers and event handler integration

2. **New Files**
   - `tests/skill_point_events_test.py`: Test script for verifying functionality
   - `tests/run_skill_point_test.py`: Simple runner for the test script

3. **API Integration**
   - Added the `awardPoints` function that can be called from any module
   - Enhanced the `award_skill_points` function in backend to track event details
   - Improved the profile module to display skill-related notifications

## Testing
A comprehensive test script was created to verify the functionality:
1. Tests the award of skill points through events
2. Verifies the point history display and persistence
3. Confirms inbox messages are generated for events
4. Validates that points are correctly stored between sessions

## Next Steps
1. Expand event types with more real gameplay conditions
2. Add animations/effects when points are awarded
3. Create a more detailed skill point economy
4. Enhance the visualization of skill point impacts on gameplay

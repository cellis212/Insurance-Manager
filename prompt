Go through the issues on the github using cursor-tools and pick the best one for you to add.  Check the local directory to see what you need to do, create a temp plan to add it in a .md file, execute that plan, test it extensively iterating until it works, then update the github and internal docs, then delete the temp file. Remember that testing requires you to use selenium






Are you sure that you have completed everything and updated the github?

# New Issues for Tech Tree Feature Enhancements

## Enhance Tech Tree with Visual Skill Tree Diagram

**Description**:
The current Tech Tree implementation uses a basic plot to show skill connections. This issue proposes enhancing the visualization with an interactive diagram that better illustrates the relationships between skills and progression paths.

**Requirements**:
- Replace the simple skill connections plot with an interactive visualization
- Add connecting lines between related skills with proper styling
- Include visual indicators for skill level progression (e.g., filled nodes, color coding)
- Ensure the visualization is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Maintain consistency with the overall dark UI theme

## Implement Persistent Skill Storage with Database

**Description**:
Currently, player skill data is stored using a file-based approach. To improve scalability, reliability, and performance, we should migrate to a proper database storage system for skill data.

**Requirements**:
- Replace the file-based skill storage with proper database integration (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Ensure skill data is properly synchronized with player profiles
- Add versioning to handle skill tree expansion and updates
- Implement proper error handling and data recovery mechanisms
- Create migration scripts to transfer existing player skill data

## Improve Selenium Test Infrastructure

**Description**:
We've created initial Selenium tests for the Tech Tree feature, but we need a more comprehensive testing framework that covers all modules of the application and integrates with continuous integration systems.

**Requirements**:
- Create a comprehensive test suite covering all app modules
- Add CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Generate test reports with screenshots and coverage metrics
- Implement test fixtures and helper functions to reduce code duplication
- Document testing approach and best practices for future development

## Add Skills Impact Visualization

**Description**:
Players need a clearer understanding of how their skill investments affect gameplay parameters. This issue proposes creating visualizations that show the impact of skills on various game metrics.

**Requirements**:
- Create a dashboard showing how skills affect game parameters
- Provide before/after comparisons when skills are upgraded
- Visualize potential benefits of skill investments
- Integrate with the existing analytics dashboard
- Use consistent styling and visualization approaches

## Implement Skill Point Award Events

**Description**:
To make skill progression more engaging, we should implement a system of events and notifications that award skill points for various achievements and actions in the game.

**Requirements**:
- Create notification system for skill point awards
- Add special events that grant bonus skill points
- Implement challenges tied to skill point rewards
- Create a history/log of skill point awards
- Balance the skill point economy to maintain game progression

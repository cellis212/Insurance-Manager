## Improve Selenium Test Infrastructure

**Description**:
We've created initial Selenium tests for the Tech Tree feature, but we need a more comprehensive testing framework that covers all modules of the application and integrates with continuous integration systems.

**Requirements**:
- Create a comprehensive test suite covering all app modules
- Add CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Generate test reports with screenshots and coverage metrics
- Implement test fixtures and helper functions to reduce code duplication
- Document testing approach and best practices for future development

**Labels**: enhancement, testing, high-priority, infrastructure

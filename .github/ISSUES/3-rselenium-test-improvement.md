# Improve RSelenium Test Coverage and Reliability

**Type**: Testing
**Priority**: Medium
**Assignee**: TBD

## Description

Our current RSelenium test suite provides basic coverage for the main functionality of the Insurance Simulation Game, but it needs to be improved to be more comprehensive and reliable. We need to expand the test coverage and enhance the reliability of the tests to ensure they consistently pass in different environments.

## Requirements

- Expand test coverage to include all major application features
- Implement proper test isolation to allow tests to run independently
- Add better error handling and cleanup for test failures
- Create test fixtures for consistent test data
- Make tests more resilient to timing issues and element loading
- Add continuous integration workflow for automated testing

## Current Issues

1. Tests sometimes fail due to timing issues with Selenium
2. Not all critical features are covered by tests
3. Tests depend on specific game state which makes them brittle
4. Test failures don't provide clear diagnostic information
5. No automated test runs in CI/CD pipeline

## Proposed Solution

1. Refactor the existing tests to use more reliable wait mechanisms
2. Create a test fixture system that resets the game state before each test
3. Implement proper cleanup after test failures
4. Add tests for all major features:
   - Administrator interface
   - Simulation control
   - Premium pricing adjustments
   - Investment strategy setting
   - Tech tree progression
   - Turn advancement
5. Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically

## Implementation Details

```R
# Example improved wait mechanism
wait_for_element_with_retry <- function(remDr, selector, timeout = SELENIUM_TIMEOUT, max_retries = 3) {
  for (retry in 1:max_retries) {
    tryCatch({
      for (i in 1:timeout) {
        elements <- remDr$findElements(using = "css selector", selector)
        
        if (length(elements) > 0 && elements[[1]]$isElementDisplayed()[[1]]) {
          return(elements[[1]])
        }
        
        Sys.sleep(0.5)
      }
      stop(paste("Element not found after", timeout, "seconds:", selector))
    }, error = function(e) {
      if (retry < max_retries) {
        cat("Retry", retry, "- Error:", e$message, "\n")
        Sys.sleep(1)
      } else {
        stop(paste("Failed after", max_retries, "retries:", e$message))
      }
    })
  }
}

# Example test fixture setup
setup_test_environment <- function(remDr) {
  # Reset application state
  remDr$executeScript("localStorage.clear();")
  remDr$navigate(TEST_URL)
  # Log in as test admin
  login_as_admin(remDr)
  # Reset game state to known fixture
  load_test_fixture(remDr)
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- All tests run successfully in the CI pipeline
- Tests cover at least 80% of critical application features
- Tests remain stable across multiple runs
- Clear error messages when tests fail
- Test suite completes in under 10 minutes
- Tests can be run independently or as a full suite

## Estimated Effort

Medium-Large (3-4 days)

# Mobile Responsive UI

**Type**: Enhancement
**Priority**: Medium
**Assignee**: TBD

## Description

The current UI of the Insurance Simulation Game works well on desktop devices but has limited responsiveness on mobile and tablet devices. We need to enhance the application to provide a better experience across all device types.

## Requirements

- Implement responsive design principles throughout the application
- Optimize the dashboard layout for portrait and landscape orientations on tablets and mobile phones
- Ensure that interactive elements (sliders, buttons, etc.) are properly sized for touch interactions
- Maintain the dark theme aesthetics across all device sizes
- Test on multiple device types and screen sizes

## Proposed Solution

We should update the UI components to use fluid containers and responsive grid layouts. The shinydashboard components should be configured to properly adjust to different screen sizes.

Key modifications:
- Replace fixed-width elements with percentage-based widths
- Add appropriate media queries in custom CSS
- Optimize the inbox view for smaller screens
- Ensure charts and graphs scale appropriately

## Acceptance Criteria

- App renders correctly on devices with screen widths from 320px to 1920px
- All interactive elements are usable on touch screens
- No horizontal scrolling required on any supported device
- All text remains readable on smaller screens
- Interactive elements maintain sufficient tap targets (minimum 48x48px)

## Estimated Effort

Medium (2-3 days)

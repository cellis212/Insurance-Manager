# Advanced Analytics Module Implementation

**Type**: Enhancement
**Priority**: High
**Assignee**: TBD

## Description

The current analytics dashboard provides basic performance metrics, but there is an opportunity to expand it with more advanced analytics features that will enhance the educational value of the simulation. This issue proposes implementing an advanced analytics module with predictive modeling and deeper insights.

## Requirements

- Implement predictive analytics for forecasting future market conditions
- Add scenario analysis tools that allow players to test "what-if" scenarios
- Create more detailed visualizations that break down performance by region and insurance line
- Include competitor benchmarking to show how a player's decisions compare to others
- Implement trend analysis to show performance changes over time
- Ensure all new analytics respect the existing dark theme UI

## Proposed Solution

1. Create a new module called `advanced_analytics_module.R` that expands on the existing analytics capabilities.
2. Use R's statistical and machine learning capabilities to implement predictive models.
3. Build interactive visualizations using plotly and ggplot2 that respond to user inputs.
4. Implement tabbed interface within the analytics dashboard to organize different types of analysis.
5. Add downloadable reports in PDF format for players to review offline.

## Implementation Details

```R
# Example structure for the advanced analytics module
advanced_analytics_ui <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  tagList(
    tabsetPanel(
      tabPanel("Predictive Models", 
        plotlyOutput(ns("forecastPlot")),
        selectInput(ns("forecastHorizon"), "Forecast Horizon", 
                   choices = c("1 Year" = 1, "3 Years" = 3, "5 Years" = 5))
      ),
      tabPanel("Scenario Analysis",
        # Scenario inputs and results
      ),
      tabPanel("Competitive Analysis", 
        # Benchmarking visualizations
      ),
      tabPanel("Trend Analysis",
        # Time series visualizations
      )
    )
  )
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- All new analytics features are accurately calculated based on simulation data
- Predictive models show confidence intervals and clearly explain their limitations
- Interactive elements are intuitive and responsive
- Performance impact is minimal (page loading under 3 seconds)
- All data visualizations maintain the dark theme aesthetics
- Module structure follows the project's existing patterns and best practices

## Estimated Effort

Large (4-5 days)

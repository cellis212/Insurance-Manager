## Implement Persistent Skill Storage with Database
 **Description**: Currently, player skill data is stored using a file-based approach. To improve scalability, reliability, and performance, we should migrate to a proper database storage system for skill data.  **Requirements**: - Replace the file-based skill storage with proper database integration (PostgreSQL or SQLite) - Ensure skill data is properly synchronized with player profiles - Add versioning to handle skill tree expansion and updates - Implement proper error handling and data recovery mechanisms - Create migration scripts to transfer existing player skill data  **Labels**: enhancement, backend, data, medium-priority  ## Improve Selenium Test Infrastructure  **Description**: We've created initial Selenium tests for the Tech Tree feature, but we need a more comprehensive testing framework that covers all modules of the application and integrates with continuous integration systems.  **Requirements**: - Create a comprehensive test suite covering all app modules - Add CI/CD integration for automated testing - Generate test reports with screenshots and coverage metrics - Implement test fixtures and helper functions to reduce code duplication - Document testing approach and best practices for future development  **Labels**: enhancement, testing, high-priority, infrastructure  ## Add Skills Impact Visualization  **Description**:

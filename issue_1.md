## Enhance Tech Tree with Visual Skill Tree Diagram

**Description**:
The current Tech Tree implementation uses a basic plot to show skill connections. This issue proposes enhancing the visualization with an interactive diagram that better illustrates the relationships between skills and progression paths.

**Requirements**:
- Replace the simple skill connections plot with an interactive visualization
- Add connecting lines between related skills with proper styling
- Include visual indicators for skill level progression (e.g., filled nodes, color coding)
- Ensure the visualization is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Maintain consistency with the overall dark UI theme

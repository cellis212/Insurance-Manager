## Implement Persistent Skill Storage with Database

**Description**:
Currently, player skill data is stored using a file-based approach. To improve scalability, reliability, and performance, we should migrate to a proper database storage system for skill data.

**Requirements**:
- Replace the file-based skill storage with proper database integration (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Ensure skill data is properly synchronized with player profiles
- Add versioning to handle skill tree expansion and updates
- Implement proper error handling and data recovery mechanisms
- Create migration scripts to transfer existing player skill data

**Labels**: enhancement, backend, data, medium-priority
